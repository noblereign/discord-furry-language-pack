    Authors Note:

    Me figuring out how the Locale system in Discord works over Telegram.
    Noble, [1/24/2023 2:54 AM]
    there's a big list containing all of the like 13k localizations
    but
    discord does the 'parsing' on the fly
    so as you get into more situations that show different strings it gets added to the 'parsed' table
    so like
    by default it'll have the first few that was needed to load discord yeah
    but then like
    if you, say, send a friend a Nitro gift
    the strings needed for the gift (you gifted someone nitro, take it for yourself, blah blah) get parsed and put into the parsed table
    okay so now that i know how that works
    the next step is
    can a plugin actually modify that

    The answer to that was: Yes! Well, it's better to just modify the big table with the normal strings, and then clear the parsed table. But it's possible, and this is proof!
    Now the Fuwwy Discord Language Pack can live on forever, as a proper plugin instead of a buggy Fiddler interception.
    2020 Tay and Noble would be proud. 2023 Tay and Noble? Mmmm... debatable.

    BIG LIST OF STRINGS: 
    actually used 'strings' seem to be in _context.messages
    english fallbacks might be _context.defaultMessages
    parsed strings are in _parsedMessages, can be 'gotten' with _getParsedMessages function

    need to have:
    - big furrified language pack (set _context.messages)
    - on plugin load, set _context.messages to furry, change all currently parsed to furry (we didn't end up doing the parsed bit)
    - on plugin unload, set _context.messages back to english, same with currently parsed, we can do this with the fallback table
