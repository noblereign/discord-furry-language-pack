# discord-furry-language-pack
 An amelioration of an ancient concept that me and a friend thought of in 2020. I am so sorry.
## Installation

### [*Vencord*](https://vencord.dev/)

Download the repo and grab the `furryLanguage` folder from within `vencord`.

[*Build Vencord from source*](https://github.com/Vendicated/Vencord/blob/main/docs/1_INSTALLING.md) with the `furryLanguage` folder in your `src/userplugins` folder.

Or something like that.

---

### ~~[*BetterDiscord*](https://betterdiscord.app)~~ <sup>*UNMAINTAINED*</sup>

**Requires [*Zere's Plugin Library*](https://betterdiscord.app/plugin/ZeresPluginLibrary).**

Once you have that, just download the plugin, drag it into your Plugins folder and switch it on. Welcome to your new hell.

---

If you want to get rid of the owospeak in the chat, you can disable it in the plugin's settings. (Vencord users are safe from this... for now.)
## Disclaimers
Before you install: Be aware that ***this language pack is pretty stereotypical, contains mildly depraved language, and has infrequent swearing.*** I'm not responsible if your parents come in and Discord drops an F-bomb or tells them to "Upload Yiff". If you think that could possibly happen to you, don't install this. (If you think at all, don't install this)

Also, this plugin only supports US English. Other languages are untested (but from what I've seen, it just stays in Furry English.)

Lastly, **this language pack was initially made a few years ago.** The language used back then used to be *wayyyyyy* worse than it is now. When I was remaking it, I actually had to tone down a lot of the original translations, because I kept taking psychic damage every time I had to continue in the original style. Nevertheless, ***some remnants of those older times may still remain.*** While it's infrequent enough now for it to not bother me too much, there are still a lot of translations I'm considering changing in the future, just so it doesn't have to be so charged. That's character development for you, I guess.

## Backstory
Back in 2020 (well, technically December 31st 2019), I had just started using Telegram. One of the first things I had found at the beginning of my journey was the *[Furry Language Pack](https://telegram.me/setlanguage/fuwwy)*. A few months later, [Taylor](https://github.com/TayIorRobinson) and I had the worst idea: *What if we took that concept and brought it over into Discord?*

The first versions of this pack were scuffed and hacky. We used Fiddler to intercept and replace the request that Discord used to get the language pack. It broke with every new Discord update. It was independent of a plugin loader, and the settings were just injected into the Language menu. It was code that should have never been brought to haunt our Earth. Eventually, though, we gave up, continued using Discord like normal people, and the Furry Language Pack faded away, leaving nothing more than a memory.

**Flash forward to today.** Why am I reviving this wretched concept? Why did I bring it back from the dead? Well, like most people, *I just got bored.* I had nothing to really do, so I took the time to learn how to make BetterDiscord plugins. This is the fruit of my labor. I definitely learned a lot, and I had a lot of fun making it! I might make more plugins in the future, but uh, don't count on it.

## Contribution
Think you can code better JavaScript than me (likely) or have a better idea for a translation (also likely)? Go ahead and submit a Pull Request! I'm fairly inexperienced with GitHub at the moment, but I'll try my best to get things going.
